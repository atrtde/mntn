# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## v1.2.0

CLI Guidelines (https://clig.dev/) alignment pass.

### Added

- **`--json`** on `dfm doctor` and `dfm profile` prints structured output instead of colored text, for scripting.
- **`-q`/`--quiet`** and **`--verbose`** global flags. `--quiet` drops per-entry/status chatter while keeping warnings, errors, and final summaries; `--verbose` prints the resolved dfm root.
- **`--no-input`** global flag disables all interactive prompts for CI/automation: confirmations default to "no" instead of blocking on stdin, and a required password that isn't in the keychain fails with a clear message instead of hanging.
- **`--dry-run`/`-n`** on `dfm backup`, `dfm restore`, `dfm sync`, and `dfm prune` previews what would happen without writing anything, staging/committing/pushing, or deleting.
- **`$DFM_ROOT`** environment variable overrides the default `~/.dfm` data directory.
- `dfm restore` and `dfm profile delete` now ask for confirmation before proceeding, matching `dfm prune`'s existing behavior — both are destructive and previously ran unprompted.
- `--help` and unexpected-error output now point at the docs and GitHub issue tracker.
- **`dfm completions <shell>`** prints a shell completion script (bash, zsh, fish, elvish, powershell); **`dfm man`** prints the roff man page.

### Changed

- **Breaking (CLI only):** `dfm backup --profile`'s `-n` short alias was removed; `-n` is now reserved for `--dry-run` per clig.dev convention. Use `-p`/`--profile` instead.

## v1.1.3

### Fixed
- Windows CI test `writes_exported_package_list_to_output_file` still failed after v1.1.2: `cmd /C echo` writes CRLF line endings, but `run_single_package_backup` wrote the captured command output to the package-list file unchanged, so Windows backups contained `\r\n` where the test (and Unix backups) expected `\n`. Output is now normalized to `\n` before writing, regardless of platform.

## v1.1.2

### Fixed
- `dfm restore`/`dfm doctor` on Windows accepted Unix-style rooted backup paths (e.g. `/etc/passwd`) as valid, letting a crafted `backup_path` in the registry escape the backup directory when joined onto it. `is_valid_backup_path` checked `Path::is_absolute()`, which on Windows requires a drive prefix (`C:\`) and so misses paths that only have a root — those still override the base path in `PathBuf::join`. The check now also rejects any path with `has_root()`.
- Windows CI test `writes_exported_package_list_to_output_file` was flaky/failing: it passed a single command-line argument containing an embedded newline (`"package-a\npackage-b"`) and expected it to survive to the child process unsplit. Windows argument parsing treats embedded newlines as a token separator, so `echo` received two separate arguments and rejoined them with a space instead. The test now drives the newline via a per-platform shell (`cmd /C` on Windows, `sh -c` elsewhere) instead of relying on raw arg content.

## v1.1.1

### Fixed
- Missing rustdoc on public modules and struct fields, now enforced via `#![warn(missing_docs)]` in `src/lib.rs`.

## v1.1.0

### Added
- **`dfm prune`** deletes backup directories left behind by profiles that no longer exist (e.g. a profile removed with `dfm profile delete`, which intentionally keeps its backup directory on disk). It lists the orphaned directories it finds and asks for confirmation — defaulting to "no" — before deleting anything.
- **`dfm doctor --include-disabled`** also runs the backup consistency check against disabled registry entries, which are skipped by default.
- **`dfm edit <registry>`** opens one of dfm's own registry/config files (`config`, `package`, `encrypted`, or `profiles`) in an editor. The editor is chosen from `--editor`/`-e`, then `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, falling back to `vi`; it can be a known name like `nano` or `emacs`, or any custom binary/command (e.g. `code --wait`).

### Changed
- `dfm backup` no longer rewrites the encrypted bundle (`dfm-encrypted-bundle.age`) when its contents haven't actually changed. `age` encryption uses a fresh salt/nonce every run, so previously the ciphertext changed on every backup regardless of whether the underlying dotfiles did, and `dfm sync` committed a near-full copy of the bundle every time — bloating the dfm repo on a long run of backup-only syncs. A small plaintext hash file (`dfm-encrypted-bundle.sha256`) is now kept alongside the bundle to detect when the archived content is unchanged; when it is, the bundle is left untouched and `dfm sync` has nothing to commit for it. Real content changes still produce a normal commit, exactly as before.
- **Breaking:** registry entry fields renamed for clarity — `source_path` is now `backup_path` (the relative path inside a backup layer) and `target_path` is now `original_path` (the absolute real-machine path). This changes the JSON keys in `config.registry.json` and `encrypted.registry.json`. Run the migration script below against your `~/.dfm` (or a custom root) before using this version:

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # Renames, per entry, in config.registry.json and encrypted.registry.json:
  #   source_path -> backup_path
  #   target_path -> original_path
  #
  # Usage: ./migrate-dfm-registry-paths.sh [dfm-root]   (defaults to ~/.dfm)
  # Each touched file is backed up as <file>.bak.<timestamp> first.
  # Safe to re-run: files with no old keys left are skipped untouched.

## v1.0.0

Initial release of `dotfiles-manager` (aliased as `dfm`).

### Added
- Profile-based dotfiles management: named profiles (e.g. work, personal, minimal) represent a context; `dfm profile create`/`delete` manage them and `dfm use` switches the active one.
- `dfm backup` copies tracked configs into `~/.dfm/backup/`; `dfm restore` restores them.
- `dfm link <repo>` clones a dotfiles repo (URL or `owner/repo`) into `~/.dfm` and restores it in one step, for new-machine setup.
- `dfm doctor` validates `dotfiles-manager`'s own registry files (`config.registry.json`, `package.registry.json`) and checks backups against the current filesystem, comparing directory config entries file-by-file and recursively. `dfm doctor --fix` rewrites the registry and profile files as pretty-printed, deterministically-sorted JSON. `--ask-password` and `--skip-encrypted` control how encrypted entries are checked.
- Encrypted configuration registry: sensitive files (SSH keys, credentials, etc.) are stored as a single passphrase-encrypted bundle (`dfm-encrypted-bundle.age`) via `age`; entries may target whole directories, not just single files. `dfm secret set`/`secret delete` store or remove the passphrase in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) so `backup`/`restore`/`doctor` don't need to prompt each run.
- `dfm git <args>` runs any git command inside `~/.dfm`; `dfm status` and `dfm diff` are shortcuts for `dfm git status`/`dfm git diff`, with extra args passed through.
- `dfm sync` stages, commits, and pushes changes inside `~/.dfm`, with a default UTC-timestamped commit message.
- Usable as a library: operations live in `dotfiles_manager::backup`, `dotfiles_manager::restore`, `dotfiles_manager::sync`, `dotfiles_manager::git`, `dotfiles_manager::doctor`, `dotfiles_manager::profiles`, `dotfiles_manager::keyring`, `dotfiles_manager::encryption`, and `dotfiles_manager::registry`, taking a `Dfm` context (custom root via `Dfm::with_root`) and returning report structs instead of printing. The CLI ships two binaries, `dotfiles-manager` and the shorter alias `dfm`, behind the default `cli` feature; depend on the library with `default-features = false`.
